## üìö About the project: 

Simple static page made for practice render content dynamically using props and map.

A simple and beautiful way to record every travel that we make around the globe, to one day we can look back and remember those good days.
Also, it's easy to share those moments with the people around us, just one click away. 

It has a lot of potential to develop over time into something more complex and functional.
